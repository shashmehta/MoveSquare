        -Use distance from 30 CM to 50 CM
        -To move backwards use a negative distance
        -startDriveToPosition and startStrafeToPosition and defined functions in last years code,
         so don't worry about errors
        -When we test, you will slack us the code, and we will add your code to our copy so we can
         test it
